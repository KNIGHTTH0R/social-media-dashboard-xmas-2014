================================

## Config file
The REST API relies on a config file that is not present in the GitHub repo because it contains API keys for social media platforms.
Copy `api/config.template.php` to `api/config.php` and enter the API keys for your accounts.
DO NOT edit `api/config.template.php` directly or commit `api/config.php` to a public GitHub repository!!
